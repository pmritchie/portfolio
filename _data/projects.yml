- name: Simple Sale Central Florida
  descr: "Simple Sale was another project I worked on at Orlando Marketers that was very template heavy in the need to duplicate pages for different cities and locations. Another obsticle that I had to overcome was finding a replacement for Google Maps address lookup. Google Maps starting to charge for their API and the client did not want to pay for that so instead I research and figured out how to implement Algolia Places"
